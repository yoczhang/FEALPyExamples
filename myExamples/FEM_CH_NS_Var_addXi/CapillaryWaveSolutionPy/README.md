# Two-dimensional-Capillary-Wave-Prosperetti-1981

Script to calculate the dispersion of a single capillary wave based on the initial-value problem [1] 
for two-fluid case with equal kinematic viscosity and one-fluid case (setting density and viscosity of the upper fluid to 0).

Inspired from Matlab Script [2,3] by Dr. Fabian Denner, Dept. Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London
